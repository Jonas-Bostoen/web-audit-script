# Performance Tests

In this repository, the Python code used to perform performance tests on different implementations is presented.
## Requirements

The code is written in Python 3.6 and requires the following packages:
- Pandas
- Seaborn

These packages can be installed using the following commands:

```bash

pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
```
In addition to the Python packages, an extra tool is needed, namely the Lighthouse tool. This tool should be installed via Node.js. This can be done by executing the following command:

```bash

npm install -g lighthouse
```
## Code

The code can be found in the script.py file and can be executed using the following command:

```bash

python script.py <url> <command-name>
```
Enter the URL of the website to be tested and specify a name for the command being executed.
